# Summary of Steven Wartik's "I'm not a real scientist, and that's okay"

In Steve Wartik's post, he talks about the progression of computer science, saying it uses elements of mathematics, engineering, and philosophy. He states that computer science lacks observation, an element that is fundamental to traditional branches of science. 

He says that the rate of experimental research in computer science has declined, compared to earlier times in the field. He states that many arguments in computer science lack support from concrete data like traditional sciences, often relying on logical reasoning. Steve Wartik notes a specific case where an argument made about software security was based on theoretical logic without tangible evidence, showing possible disasters. 

Steve Wartik also says that mathematics most definitely influences computer sciences, but computer science isn't and cannot be formalized enough to completely be a branch of mathematics.

Steve believes that computer science would best be viewed as a branch of philosophy. He says this because of the logic behind computer science. He connects this to his other idea by saying that computer science is logic without observation, in traditional science, a theory fails if it doesn't predict observation, but in computer science, there is no observation. 

He says that this lack of observation or in another sense actual real world testing, is dangerous to not have. He exemplifies this by talking about a paper he saw that argued why open source software is inherently less secure than proprietary software. It had perfect logic to it, yet, he says in the real world, Microsoft's software has had many more security flaws in it than open source software.


### John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan

> John Hopcroft is a well known computer scientist. He is known for his contributions to formal languages, algorithms, and theory. He is also famously known for his Hopcroft algorithm that minimizes DFAs (Deterministic Finite Automata). DFAs simply put are machines in computer science that are used to recognize patterns and process input strings.

> Robert Tarjan is also a well known computer scientist who went to Princeton. Like John, he is well known for his algorithm design and analysis work. He is famously known for his Tarjan algorithm for finding related components in graphs. 

Both men won the Turing Award, both in 1986. They collaborated together to make the Hopcroft-Tarjan algorithm that finds highly matching elements in bipartite graphs.
