# Summary of Steven Wartik's "I'm not a real scientist, and that's okay"

In Steve Wartik's post, he talks about the progression of computer science, saying it uses elements of mathematics, engineering, and philosophy. He states that computer science lacks observation, an element that is fundamental to traditional branches of science. 

He says that the rate of experimental research in computer science has declined, compared to earlier times in the field. He states that many arguments in computer science lack support from concrete data like traditional sciences, often relying on logical reasoning. Steve Wartik notes a specific case where an argument made about software security was based on theoretical logic without tangible evidence, showing possible disasters.
