# Chapter 0 Preliminary Notes

## Guiding Questions

1. What is discrete math?
> Discrete math is a subject of mathematics that uses distinct, seperable objects, with a focus on logic and proofs.

2. What are the four main topics that Professor Levin says will be presented in the book?
>
- Combinatorics
- Sequences
- Symbolic Logic
- Graph Theory

3. What are discrete structures? Which specific examples are listed in the chapter? Briefly describe each of these.
> Discrete structures are objects used to represent mathematical values in proofs or problems.

> Specific structures listed in chapter (I had to look up a few): 

| Structure       | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Sets            | A collection of distinct objects. |
| Functions       | A mapping from inputs to outputs. |
| Sequences       | An ordered list of objects. |
| Relations       | A set of ordered pairs. |
| Graphs          | Vertices connected by edges. |
| Multisets       | Sets allowing multiple instances of elements. |
| Finite Geometries| Structures with finite points and lines. |
| Designs         | Balanced combinatorial structures. |
| Linked Lists    | Nodes linked linearly. |
| Red-Black Trees | Self-balancing binary trees. |
| Groups          | A set with an operation combining elements. |
| Rings           | A set with addition and multiplication operations. |
| Matroids        | Generalization of linear independence. |
| POSets          | Partially ordered sets. |
| Boolean Algebras| Logic structures with AND, OR, NOT. |

## Other Notes
- Discrete math is hard to define, it is a large umbrella term.
- Discrete sets are sets that have seperate elements with each input being individual, hence the name discrete.
- If a set consists of all real numbers it is not discrete.
- Tools in discrete math are named *discrete structures*.
