## Vocab

- premise
> All statements but the last in an argument

- conclusion
> The last statement in an argument

- argument
> A sequence of statements

- theorem
> A name for a general mathematical truth

- proposition
> A name for a general mathematical truth

- proof
> A valid argument to prove a mathematical truth

- statement
> A declarative sentence that is either true or false

- quantifier
>  A symbol indicatign the scope of the predicate

- predicate
> A statement containing variables

- logical connective
> The technical name for Logic gates in mathematics

- binary connective
> A logical connective that connects two statements

- unary connective
> A logical connective that applies to a single statement

- truth value
> A value indicating whether the statement is true or false 

- propositional variables
> Variables that are usually capital letters that stand in for statements.

- conjunction
> A statement formed by joining two statements with the connector AND

- disjunction
> A statement formed by joining two statements with the connector OR

- implication
> A statement formed where 'If P, then Q'

- conditional
> A statement formed where 'If P, then Q'

- biconditional
> A statement formed where 'P, if and only if Q'

- negation
> A statement where the truth value of a statement is swaped.

- truth conditions
> The outcome truth value of a statement after using logical connectives.

## Extra Notes

- The main goal of math is to establish mathematical truths.
- A statement is atomic if it cannot be divided into more proofs.
- If it is not atomic, it is molecular.
- Statements must be boolean values.
