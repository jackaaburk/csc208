1. Translate into English:

(a) $\forall x (E(x) \imp E(x +2))$

> For all values of $x$, if $x$ is even, then $x + 2$ is  even.

(b) $\forall x \exists y (\sin(x) = y)$

> For all values of $x$, there is some $y$ value that equals the sine of $x$

(c) $\forall y \exists x (\sin(x) = y)$

> For all values of y, there is some sine of x that equals y. 

(d) $\forall x \forall y (x^3 = y^3 \imp x = y)$

> For all values of $x$ and $y$, if $x^3 = y^3$, then $x = y$.

2. Consider the statement, “If Oscar eats Chinese food, then he drinks milk.”

(a) Write the converse of the statement.

> If Oscar drinks milk, then he eats Chinese food.

(b) Write the contrapositive of the statement.

> If Oscar does not drink milk, then he does not eat Chinese food.

(c) Is it possible for the contrapositive to be false? If it was, what would that tell you?

> Contrapositives of true statements are always true. Thus, the original statement would need to be false as well for it to be true.

(d) Suppose the original statement is true, and that Oscar drinks milk. Can you conclude anything (about his eating Chinese food)? Explain.

> This doesn't necessarily imply he eats Chinese food. For example, if you take the converse of the statement, and say that he drinks milk but does not eat Chinese food, and the converse statement would be: "If Oscar drinks milk, then he eats Chinese food". It is a false implication if he doesn't eat Chinese food.

(e) Suppose the original statement is true, and that Oscar does not drink milk. Can you conclude anything (about his eating Chinese food)? Explain.

> If the original statement is true, and Oscar does not drink milk, then he cannot have eaten Chinese food, as if he did, the only way for the statement to be true would be if he had drank milk.
