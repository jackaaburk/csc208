# Chapter 1 Section 2 Notes on Logic & Proofs

## Vocab

- Implication
> It is a molecular statement of the form $P \rightarrow Q$

- Conditional: 
> Also known as an Implication $P \rightarrow Q$

- Converse: 
> Regarding a certain implication, it is the opposite. Using the above defined implication it would be $Q \rightarrow P$.

- Contrapositive: 
> Regarding a certain implication, it is the opposite and the negation. Using the above defined implication it would be $\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$

- Inverse: 
> Regarding a certain implication, it takes the negation . Using the above defined implication it would be $\neg P \rightarrow \neg Q$

## Extra Notes

- The inverse is just a contrapositive of a converse.
- The most important statement in math is implication.
- Implications are important to math because you wouldn't be able to amke claims otherwise. With implications, you can say, if this, then that, therefore making a claim.
- Outside quantifiers are ignoresd when formatting converses, contrapositives, and inverses.
- True implications can have false converses.
- The contrapositive of a true statement will always be true.
- When implication and converse are both true, P and Q are equivalent.
