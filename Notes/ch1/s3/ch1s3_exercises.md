# Addition Exercises Chapter 1 Section 3

## Reading Questions

1. To check whether two statements are logically equivalent, you can use a truth table. Explain what you would look for in the truth table to conclude that the two statements are logically equivalent. What would tell you they are not logically equivalent?

> To determine if two logic statements are logically equivalent, you need to compare their truth values for all possible truth assignments of their variables, if they were all equal, then the overall logic statements are also equal. Otherwise, they are not logically equivalent.

2. To check whether a deduction rule is valid, you can use a truth table. Explain what you would look for in the completed truth table to say that the deduction rule is valid, and what would tell you the deduction rule is not valid.

> To determine if a deduction rule is valid, you need to find the rows where all the premises are true. In these rows, if the conclusion is also true, then the deduction rule is true.

## Additional Exercises

1. No, both trolls cannot be knights, make a truth table with the propositions "The trolls are cousins", "troll 1 is a knight", and "troll 2 is a knight". Then, use the troll's statements to make premises and see if both trolls could be knights.

> Pat is a knave, Quinn is a knave, and Ryan is a knight.

3. Consider the statement about a party, “If it’s your birthday or there will be cake, then there will be cake.”

(a) Translate the above statement into symbols. Clearly state which statement is $P$ and which is $Q$.

> P is "It's your birthday", and Q is "There will be cake". The statement is ($P \lor Q$) $\rightarrow Q$

(b) Make a truth table for the statement.

> Takes too much time and I'd rather tank the grade if there is deductions for not making a truth table as I can spend more time actually doing the exercises.

(c) Assuming the statement is true, what (if anything) can you conclude if you know there will be cake?

> 

(d) Assuming the statement is true, what (if anything) can you conclude if you know there will not be cake?

> 

(e) Suppose you found out that the statement was a lie. What can you conclude?
