# Chapter 1 Section 3 Notes on Logic & Proofs

## Vocab

- Truth Table

> A method to deduce relationships between logical statements. Ex. $P \rightarrow Q$ is the same as $\neg P \or Q$, and this can be found using truth tables.

- Tautology

> A statement that is true by necessity, due to its logical form.

- Logical Equivalence

> When two logical statements are logically result in the same outcome no matter P and Q's truthiness.

- Deduction Rule

> An argument form that is always valid.

## Extra Notes

- Implications are logically equivalent to their contrapositives.
- In truth tables, if the two logic statements you are comparing have the exact same values in their columns, they are logically equivalent no matter what.
- The negation of a disjunction/conjunction is logically equivalent to a disjuncion/conjunction of negations.
- Double negation is essentially just two negatives in math, it makes a positive.
- Negations of implications are conjunctions.
- You can't switch orders of quantifiers whilst still retaining logical equivalence between the statements.
- You can pass negations past a quantifier, but then you must swap the type of the quantifier.
- $\neg \forall x P(x) \text{ is equivalent to } \exists x \neg P(x)$.
- $\neg \exists x P(x) \text{ is equivalent to } \forall x \neg P(x)$.
- Boolean algebra is used to transform statements.
