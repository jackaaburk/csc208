# Chapter 1 Section 4 Notes on Logic & Proofs

## Vocab

- Direct Proof

> A way of proving truthiness of a logic statement through combinations of facts; You define every variable, assume P, and use facts to say "therefore Q".

- Proof by contrapositive

> Directly proves $\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$.

- Proof by contradiction

> If $P$ is false, a direct proof for $\neg P$ being false, would conclude that $P$ is true.

## Extra Notes

- There may not be a guaranteed way to succeed in proving.

- You can be very creative in proofs and discrete math.

- To write proofs, you must use foundational techniques.

- Logical structure is the backbone of the proof.

- All proofs must involve traditional math concepts, as well as their logical structure.

- Being paranoid with proofs is good, it can make you rethink proofs and verify them.

- Like stated in the vocab, contrapositives can prove original statements since they're logically equivalent.
