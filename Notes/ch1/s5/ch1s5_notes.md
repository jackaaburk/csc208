# Chapter 1 Section 5 Notes on Logic & Proofs

## Vocab

- Set:

> An unordered collection of elements.

- Subset:

> A set where every element of the set is contained in another set, and the other set contains more information that isn't in the subset.

- Superset:

> A set that contains every element of another set and more.

- Proper Subset:

> A subset is proper when every element in set A are in set B, but B doesn't equal A.

- Cardinality:

> The number of elements in a set.

- Injective:

> A function where each element maps to another element in a different domian. Ex. a one-to-one relationship.

- Graph:

> A set V of vertices and a set E of edges.

- Corollary:

> The result of applying a theorem to prove another result.

- Edges:

> Two element subsets that contain vertices as the elements.

## Extra Notes

- Some discrete structures pertain to particular ways of proving with standard proof techniques that apply to them.

- A relation on set A is a set of ordered pairs from A.

- Relations permeate all types of mathematics.

- Two line notation can be used to describe a function where the top are inputs and the bottom are outputs.

- Since graphs represent a type of relationship between elements, you can use graphs to represent many real-world situations.
