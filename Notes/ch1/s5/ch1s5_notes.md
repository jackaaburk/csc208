# Chapter 1 Section 5 Notes on Logic & Proofs

## Vocab

- Set:

> An unordered collection of elements.

- Subset:

> A set where every element of the set is contained in another set, and the other set contains more information that isn't in the subset.

- Superset:

> A set that contains every element of another set and more.

- Proper Subset:

> A subset is proper when every element in set A are in set B, but B doesn't equal A.

- Cardinality:

> The number of elements in a set.

- Injective:

> A function where each element maps to another element in a different domian. Ex. a one-to-one relationship.

- Graph:

> A set V of vertices and a set E of edges.

- Corollary:

> The result of applying a theorem to prove another result.

- Edges:

> Two element subsets that contain vertices as the elements.
