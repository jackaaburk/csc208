# Chapter 4 Problems 3 and 4

## Problem 3 (Jack)

Find a closed formula for the sequence that starts $2, 4, 6, 8 \cdot \cdot \cdot$. Assume $a_0 = 2$.

- Arithmetic sequence

- To make it so we can find $a_n$ at any point, we can just add a coefficient of common difference.

- Since $a_0 = 2$, we need to also add 2.

> Thus, the answer is: $2n + 2$

## Problem 4 (Yuri)

**Problem:** Find a closed formula for the sequence that starts


15, 18, 21, 24, 27, â€¦


Assume \\(a_0 = 15\\).


**Solution:**


This is an arithmetic sequence with:

\\[ a_0 = 15, \quad \text{common difference } d = 3 \\]


The general formula for an arithmetic sequence is:

\\[ a_n = a_0 + n \cdot d \\]


Substituting in the known values:

\\[ a_n = 15 + 3 \cdot n \\]


**Answer:**

\\[ \boxed{a_n = 15 + 3n} \\]
