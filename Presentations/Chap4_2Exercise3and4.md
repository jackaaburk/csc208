# Chapter 4 Problems 3 and 4

## Problem 3

Find a closed formula for the sequence that starts $2, 4, 6, 8 \cdot \cdot \cdot$. Assume $a_0 = 2$.

- To make it so we can find $a_n$ at any point, we can just add a coefficient of common difference.

- Since $a_0 = 2$, we need to also add 2.

> Thus, the answer is: $2n + 2$
