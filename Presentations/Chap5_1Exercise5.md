# Chapter 5 Exercise 5

## Exercise 5

Find a set of smallest possible size that has both ${1,3,9,10}$ and ${2,3,5,7}$ as subsets.

Let:

- Set $A = {1, 3, 9, 10}$

- Set $B = {2, 3, 5, 7}$

> For a set to have subsets A and B, it must contain at least the union of both A and B.

- Union of sets $A \cup B = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10}$

- Since removing any of the items from this set would result in either A or B not being fully contained, this is the smallest set (of size 7) that contains both A and B.
