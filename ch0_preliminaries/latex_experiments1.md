### Proof of $1 + 1 = 3$

Let $x = 1$ and $y = 1$.
Let $x = a$ and $y = b$

1. First, define $z = x + y$
$z = 1 + 1 = 2$.

2. Next, multiply z by x.
$z \times x = 2 \times 1 = 2$

3. Now, cube both sides of z.
$z^3 = 2^3 = 8$

(Number 4 is where chicanery begins)
4. Since we earlier made $x \times z = 2$, $z^3 \div x^3 = 2^3$
We can divide $2^3 by z$ which is $8 \div 2$, leaving the equation to be $x^3 \div 2 = 4$

5. With $x^3 \div 2 = 4$, we can solve for $x$, first, multiply by 2.
$x^3 = 8$

6. Now, cube root both sides.
$x = 2$

7. Plug $x$ back into $a + b$.
$x + y$
$2 + 1$
$3$

Therefore $1 + 1 = 3$
